#This is a python code that censors every character that is not the last 4 characters in a string
#defining a function and allat
#good pracitce for getting used to list functions in python

#GAME PLAN:
#find a way to iterate through a string
#count the number of characters
#subtract that number by 4
#replace all characters position 0 - x with "#"
#create if/else statement that'll just print the string if <4
