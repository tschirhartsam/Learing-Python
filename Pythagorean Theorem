#FIRSTRY
#This is going to be my first attempt at connecting everything that I have learned in Python so far
#it'll take user inputs and define them as a variable, and use that information to calculate something
#to start, the first portion will just be the Pythagorean theorem


#Taking the user input for the variables
a = int(input("Please enter the first length: "))
b = int(input("Please enter the second length: "))


#Calculating the first portion of the equation
c = (a * a) + (b * b)
csquared = c ** .5

#Printing the results of the equation
print("The longest length of the triangle is: ", csquared)
