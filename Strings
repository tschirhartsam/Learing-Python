word = "tschirhart"

print word[0]   #prints the first character in the string
print word[9]   #prints the last character in the string
print word[-2]  #prints the second to last character in the string, using a negative number

#slicing indices
#Slice indices have useful defaults; an omitted first index defaults to zero, an omitted second index defaults to the size of the string being sliced.
#Note how the start is always included, and the end always excluded. This makes sure that s[:i] + s[i:] is always equal to s:

print word[3:6]     #prints 'hir'
print word[:4]  #prints 'tschi'
print word[2:]  #prints 'chirhart'

#using an out of range slice on an index
print word[40:]

#creating a new string using the indexes
print "hello" + word[2:]

#using the built in function of len() to return the amount of characters in a string
print len(word)
