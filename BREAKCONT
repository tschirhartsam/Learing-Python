for n in range(2, 10): #this defines n as a valule between 2 and 10
    for x in  range(2, n): #this defines x as a value between 2 and the value of n
        if n % x == 0:  #prints the remainder in division of n divided by x
            print(n, 'equals', x, '*', n//x)    #prints
            break


    else: print(n, 'is a prime number') #a prompt that prints should the values not have any remainders or divisible values



#using the continue statement in a for loop
for num in range(2, 10):
    if num % 2 == 0:
        print("Found an even number", num)
        continue
    print("Found an odd number", num)

#pass statements
#the pass statement does nothing. can be used when a statement is required syntactically but the program requires no action.
#an example:
while True:
    pass

#or for creating minimal classes
class MyEmptyClass:
    pass
